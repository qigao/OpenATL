# ATL source compatibility — COM Client and COM Server

**OpenATL targets ATL source compatibility for both COM Client and COM
Server applications**, together with Win32/WTL. The current implementation
qualifies a subset; missing APIs are implementation backlog, not permanently
excluded. Microsoft's internal ATL ABI/layout is not currently claimed
compatible. See [the project charter](PROJECT_SCOPE.md).
Consumers link only `OpenATL::ATL`; it supplies both ATL and adapted WTL headers.

The acceptance target is now all official WTL samples and all pure ATL
Microsoft samples, unchanged on both MSVC and MinGW, with no MFC dependency.
The implemented subset below is the current state, not a restriction on that
target. Missing standard headers and APIs remain compatibility gaps; see the
[full sample inventory and build results](OFFICIAL_SAMPLES.md).

| Header/API | Supported contract |
| --- | --- |
| `atlbase.h`, `atlcomcli.h` | Existing Win32 modules, threading policies, COM smart pointers, BSTR/VARIANT helpers |
| `atlwin.h`, `atlstr.h`, utility headers | Existing documented Windows/WTL subset; Unicode-only, C++17 |
| `atlhost.h`, `atliface.h` | Windowed OLE containment, `CAxWindow`/`CAxWindow2`, site/ambient interfaces and explicit control creation; see [ownership contract](ACTIVEX_HOST.md) |
| `atlcom.h` / `atlctl.h` | `AtlAdvise`/`AtlUnadvise`, `IDispEventSimpleImpl`, typed `SINK_ENTRY_INFO` maps |
| `atlbase.h`: `CAtlModule`, `CAtlModuleT`, `CAtlExeModuleT` | Module locks, termination callbacks, balanced COM startup and explicit class-factory registration; see [module protocol](ATL_MODULE.md) |
| `atlcom.h`: `CComObjectRootBase`, `CComObjectRootEx`, `CComObjectRoot` | Nonaggregated reference counting, thread-model critical section, construction/release hooks |
| `CComObject<T>` | Concrete IUnknown, raw creation with initial reference count **zero**, typed QI, last-release destruction |
| `CComCoClass<T, &CLSID>`, `CComCreator<Object>` | Local nonaggregated creation, CLSID accessor, aggregation rejection |
| `BEGIN_COM_MAP` / `END_COM_MAP` | First simple entry supplies canonical IUnknown; typed pointer adjustments |
| `COM_INTERFACE_ENTRY`, `COM_INTERFACE_ENTRY_IID` | Interface type or explicit IID mapping |
| `COM_INTERFACE_ENTRY2`, `COM_INTERFACE_ENTRY2_IID` | Select the inheritance branch for an ambiguous base interface |
| `DECLARE_NOT_AGGREGATABLE` | Select the nonaggregated creator |
| `DECLARE_PROTECT_FINAL_CONSTRUCT` | Retain/release the construction guard reference |
| WTL `CAppModule::Init` | `Init(hInstance)` and ordinary `Init(nullptr, hInstance)`; nonempty object maps/type-library IDs currently fail explicitly (missing compatibility) |
| `openatl/com_server.h` / `com_registration.h` | Explicit in-process COM Server, IClassFactory, module/server locks, CLSID/ProgID registration and Windows STA/MTA activation (implemented subset) |

Reference-count and ownership semantics follow the corresponding ATL APIs.
`CComObject<T>::CreateInstance(&raw)` returns zero references: immediately
`AddRef`, or obtain an owned interface through `QueryInterface`, then balance
every successful acquisition. `CComCoClass::CreateInstance` returns an owned
interface with one reference. `GetUnknown()` is borrowed; QI returns ownership.
Unsupported IIDs clear output and return `E_NOINTERFACE`; null outputs return
`E_POINTER`. A temporary reference protects QI/Release during `FinalConstruct`.
HRESULT failure or exceptions destroy partial objects and call `FinalRelease`;
a throwing constructor does not call it. `CAtlException` preserves a failure
HRESULT, allocation failure maps to `E_OUTOFMEMORY`, other exceptions to
`E_UNEXPECTED`. Destructors and `FinalRelease` must not throw.

Thread models have their usual separation: `CComSingleThreadModel` requires
external serialization; `CComMultiThreadModel` synchronizes the reference
count and provides explicit `Lock`/`Unlock`. This does not marshal interfaces
or synchronize application fields automatically.

When an application declares a `CAtlModule`-derived module, `CComObject`
automatically retains it through destruction. Without one, local creation is
independent of a module. The separate `OpenATL::COM::Module` lifetime still
requires its explicit creator overload for a DLL class table:

```cpp
const OpenATL::COM::ClassEntry classes[] = {
    {CLSID_MyObject, &ATL::CComObject<MyObject>::CreateInstance}
};
OpenATL::COM::Module module(classes, 1);
```

An object class uses the usual root + interfaces + COM-map pattern; it cannot
be `final` because `CComObject<T>` derives from it. The class may also inherit
`CComCoClass<T, &CLSID_MyObject>`. DLL exports and registration use the existing
[explicit server API](COM_SERVER.md). Direct local creation does not acquire a
DLL module reference; a DLL must use the module-aware creator or independently
retain its module across locally created objects and external callers.

**Tracked compatibility gaps:** `CAtlDllModuleT`, standard automatic/chained
object maps, aggregation and tear-offs, `IDispatchImpl`/type libraries,
connection-point server templates, RGS, SAFEARRAY wrappers, windowless
hosting, resource-based ActiveX dialogs and complete control/server support.
`CComModule` is currently unimplemented but not prohibited by policy; assess
it against unchanged ATL consumers. Windowed containment and typed simple
event sinks are implemented. Missing APIs must not claim fake success.
Real COM Server support already covers explicit class factories, module
locks, registration and native STA/MTA activation. No claim of complete
application compatibility is made yet.

Existing native COM core tests cover zero-ref creation, typed/IID queries,
multiple inheritance, canonical identity, construction failure and cleanup,
threaded references, single-thread policy, and explicit module pin retirement.
The pinned community WTL SDI fixture builds and runs without source patches, including
its existing `<atlcom.h>` include and `Init(nullptr, hInstance)` call.
It is not an official sample. [Official sample coverage](OFFICIAL_SAMPLES.md)
records separate WTL GuidGen/MemDlg tests and the gaps observed in Microsoft's
COMMap, ATLCollections and ATLSafeArray sources. The separate
[RATL sample admission](RATL_SAMPLES.md) records three unchanged applications
passing native behavior tests against OpenATL, plus the module API coverage.
